# Would You Rather Project

This app follows all the basic requirements in the rubric as well as a simple authentication with cookie.

## Features

- Heavyly based on Material UI on UI design with a little help from React-bootstrap and React-fontawesome.

- Use cookie to save user information in browsers. So don't need to worry about login again everytime when refreshing the page. Logout will destroy the cookie so that login is required then.

## Installation and lauch

only `npm install` and `npm start`

## Existing issues

- For this app is not CSS oriented, the CSS and UI structure code for components is probably not very organized. Please try to ignore it.

- The cookie function is just a simple demonstration. No timeout or other complex functionality implemented.
